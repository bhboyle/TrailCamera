This project is going to be a DIY trail camera for my hunting blind. It will be made with a Raspberry pi Zero 2 W and the camera module is still being determined.

The code is this repo is the main Python code used to manage the camera. This is my first Python script so it will evolve as I get better ( I hope) at Python development.

There will also be SMB shares and a web page setup on the Pi so that I will be able to look at and retrieve the pictures via WIFI.

I will likely add settings for both of those features as the project progresses.

More to come.
